# PRM (Personal Relationship Manager)
 ... is the power of a CRM and the ease of a Contact Mobile app. Manage your personal network of contacts and companies. Stay on top of what you need to do with notes, todos, and events.

## Core Features include:
- Save time and energy by importing your business cards or event invitations directly into your PRM
- Let the PRM keep you focused by providing notifications on upcoming events and todos as they approach
- Quickly call or mail your contacts at the touch of a button
- Pull up the directions to your event from the address
- Because everything is interconnected you can readily see all your contacts who work at any company, or jump to the relevent companies and contacts from your todos and events
